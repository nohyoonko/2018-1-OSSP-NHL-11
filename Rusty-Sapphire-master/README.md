# Rusty-Sapphire
An artificial intelligence for the game Tetris with a fully functional Tetris emulator in C. Combine different types of AI and learning algorithms

Compilation:

On Linux/MAC OS:
Type the command "make" on a terminal, in the folder where the sources and the makefile are located


Execution:

On Linux/MAC OS:
execute using "./Tetris" after compilation


The program is set to run the AI reading the pieces from the "pieces" file, and writing the moves executed in the "moves" file.
/!\ It automatically generates a pieces file, and overrides the previous one /!\ Comment the "generatePiecesFile(LENGTH)" line to avoid that 

The main function is located in "Tetris.c". From there, you can choose to:
	- run the AI using the "pieces" file as an input
	- run the genetic algorithm
	- run the hill climbing algorithm

Comment or uncomment the lines corresponding to the different actions.

The parameters are set as follows:
	- LENGTH: 1000, number of pieces to generate/read/play
	- DISPLAY: 1, allows the program to display the game board after every move played
	- DEPTH: 2, the depth the AI uses to look the pieces ahead
	- GENETIC_GENERATIONS_NB: 100, number of generations generated by the genetic algorithm
	- GENETIC_GAMES_NB: 10, number of games per individual and per generation
	- GENETIC_PIECES_LENGTH: 10000, number of pieces per game
	- GENES_NB: 100, number of individuals per generation
	- PRECISION: 0.001, slight modification for genetic algorithm, or modification for hill climbing
	- HILL_CLIMBING_GAMES_NB: 10, number of games played per modification in hill climbing
	- HILL_CLIMBING_GAME_LENGTH: 10000, number of pieces per game for hill climbing

You can find these constants in "Tetris.h" and modify them as your convenience
